                <h2>The Summer We Had Been Waiting For</h2>
                <p>The excitement began long before the trip itself. The moment my parents announced that we were travelling to Singapore for our summer holidays, my heart started counting down the days. This was going to be our first trip abroad, and more importantly, my first time flying on an aeroplane!</p>
                <p>Suitcases were neatly packed, passports checked a hundred times, and snacks stored in every corner of our bags. The night before departure, I hardly slept. My mind kept painting pictures of a stunning city filled with towering buildings, thrilling rides, and sparkling lights.</p>

                <p class="divider">⸻</p>

                <h2>The Journey to the Airport</h2>
                <p>We left home while the sun was still waking up. The early morning breeze made everything feel fresh and adventurous. The drive to the airport felt like entering a new world — a world of travellers, airplanes, and dreams ready to take flight.</p>
                <p>When I stepped inside the airport, I couldn't stop looking around. The place was busy yet beautifully organized. People were moving everywhere — some waving goodbye, some rushing with luggage, and some calmly sipping coffee. I felt like a tiny explorer in a grand world.</p>

                <p class="divider">⸻</p>

                <h2>First-Time Flyers</h2>
                <p>After checking in and handing our luggage over, we waited near the boarding gate. Through the huge glass windows, I saw airplanes of all shapes and sizes gliding across the runway. "I'll be inside one of those soon," I whispered to my sister, and we both giggled nervously.</p>
                <p>When it was time to board, we walked along the long tunnel called the aerobridge. As I entered the plane, I smiled at the flight attendants who welcomed us warmly. I quickly found my seat near the window — the best place to witness the magic of the sky.</p>

                <p class="divider">⸻</p>

                <h2>Takeoff: The Moment of Wonder</h2>
                <p>The engines roared louder and louder. My stomach fluttered with excitement and a tiny bit of fear. Then, suddenly, the ground fell away beneath us. We were flying! I watched buildings become tiny blocks and cars turn into dots. Soon, we were above the clouds — floating in a dreamy white world.</p>
                <p>I pressed my face to the window the entire time, mesmerized by the beauty below. It felt like opening the door to a whole new perspective.</p>

                <p class="divider">⸻</p>

                <h2>The Fun of Flying</h2>
                <p>The flight attendants brought us food trays that looked and tasted extra special just because they were served in the sky. I watched a movie, listened to music, and played a few games on the screen in front of me. My family excitedly discussed all the places we would visit once we reached Singapore. Every plan made the journey feel even more magical.</p>

                <h2>Touchdown in Singapore</h2>
                <p>As we landed, I saw bright city lights scattered like jewels across the island. When we stepped into Changi Airport, my jaw dropped. There were indoor gardens, waterfalls, art displays, and shops everywhere. Everything looked futuristic — even the baggage counters seemed fancy!</p>
                <p>We collected our luggage and took a taxi to our hotel. I stared out the window at the shining skyscrapers and perfect roads. Singapore looked like a city straight from the future.</p>

                <h2>Exploring a New World</h2>
                <p>Our days in Singapore were packed with excitement. We visited the famous Merlion Park, where the huge Merlion statue stood proudly facing the sea. We clicked pictures with Marina Bay Sands glowing behind us. At Universal Studios, we screamed with joy on roller coasters and met characters from movies we loved.</p>
                <p>We also experienced the magic of the Night Safari, where animals lived freely in the soft glow of moonlight. Gardens by the Bay amazed us with tall Supertrees that sparkled in rainbow colours after sunset. Every moment felt like a page from a storybook.</p>

                <h2>Family Time and Priceless Memories</h2>
                <p>What I enjoyed most was the time spent laughing and exploring with my family. We tried different foods, shopped for cute souvenirs, and admired every little detail of the city. Singapore wasn't just beautiful — it was full of warmth, cleanliness, and creativity.</p>
                <p>One evening, while watching a colourful light and water show, I realized how lucky I was to experience such a beautiful place.</p>

                <h2>A Journey That Changed Me</h2>
                <p>Our summer vacation came to an end too soon. As the plane flew us back home, I looked out of the window once more — but this time with a thankful heart. That trip taught me that the world is much bigger and more amazing than I had ever imagined.</p>
                <p>My first flight to Singapore will forever remain one of the happiest memories of my life. It was a journey filled with excitement, wonder, and love — a journey that opened the sky to me and turned my dreams into reality.</p>
